### {{< emoji ":speaking_head:" >}} Overview

In the Java platform, we usually run the unit tests through some build tool, such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org), [Gradle](https://gradle.org), and so on.
However, it is hard to run the unit tests on the cli environment, since it is not clearly to execute them.
Also, computing coverage makes us more complicated.

Then, `omelette` runs unit tests of given project and compute test coverage by [Jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).
