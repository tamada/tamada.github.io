      <description>ðŸ—£ Overview The software birthmarks were proposed for detecting the software theft from a large number of suspected programs. The birthmark is a technique to compare the extracted characteristics as the software birthmarks, and compute similarities between two birthmarks. The conventional birthmarks require a much time by increasing the target programs for comparison. Therefore, it is the bottleneck of the conventional birthmarking technique. In this paper, we propose a method for reducing total processing time by introducing the narrowing phase between conventional extracting and comparison phases.</description>
