      <description>:speaking_head: Overview In software development, multiple developers compose a team, and perform a development process. To succeed the development, understanding developers&amp;rsquo; characteristics are needed. However, there is no way to measure the characteristics of the developer by quantitative analysis. Therefore, a project manager often assigns team members based on his/her own sense, considering experience year of them.
This paper proposes a measurement framework for developers&amp;rsquo; characteristics using quantitative historical data. The proposed framework is useful for measuring developers&amp;rsquo; characteristics and building a team based on quantitative analysis.</description>
