      <description>🗣 Overview This research topic aims to build a helpful bot for the software development. Also, the topic focuses on the bot on the Social Coding Platform in the social network services. The one goal of the topic is to build a bot for gently helping GitHub flow.

      <description>🗣 Overview Social coding platforms (SCPs) have realized spontaneous software evolution, where new source code and ideas are spontaneously proposed by altruistic developers. Although there are many projects operated by active communities performing spontaneous evolution, it is yet unclear that how such successful projects and communities have been formed and governed. In this paper, we propose a method that can investigate the history of every project in the SCP. Introducing the concept of project as a city, we consider every project in the SCP as a city, where a government and citizens develop a city through collaborative activities.</description>

      <description>🗣 Overview This topic is for mining software repositories. The following surveys were done.
 why do the developers update the build files in the project, and how to build the obliging bots for supporting next action.  📚 Publications  鐘ヶ江 由佳，玉田 春昭，畑 秀明，”GitHubにおける言語ごとのビルドファイルの更新理由調査”， 研究報告ソフトウェア工学（SE）, Vol. 2017-SE-196, No.28, July 2017.

      <title>Characteristics of the developers</title>
      <link>https://tamada.github.io/research/characteristics_of_developers/</link>

      <guid>https://tamada.github.io/research/characteristics_of_developers/</guid>
      <description>🗣 Overview In software development, multiple developers compose a team, and perform a development process. To succeed the development, understanding developers&amp;rsquo; characteristics are needed. However, there is no way to measure the characteristics of the developer by quantitative analysis. Therefore, a project manager often assigns team members based on his/her own sense, considering experience year of them.
This paper proposes a measurement framework for developers&amp;rsquo; characteristics using quantitative historical data. The proposed framework is useful for measuring developers&amp;rsquo; characteristics and building a team based on quantitative analysis.</description>
