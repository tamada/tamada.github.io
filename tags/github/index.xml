&lt;p&gt;Learning the git and GitHub operation is difficult for novice programmers.
Since even programming is a pretty complicated task, it becomes challenging to consider various kinds of operation except programming, for example, good commit, pull requests, and etc.
However, the recent development process ordinary manages product versions with SCM such as &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.
Therefore, it requires the novices should learn them as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tamada.github.io/research/git_operation_supports/features.png"/></item><item><title>Project as a City</title><link>https://tamada.github.io/research/project_as_a_city/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tamada.github.io/research/project_as_a_city/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="relative group"&gt;:speaking_head: Overview

&lt;p&gt;Social coding platforms (SCPs) have realized &lt;em&gt;spontaneous software evolution&lt;/em&gt;, where new source code and ideas are spontaneously proposed by altruistic developers.
Although there are many projects operated by active communities performing spontaneous evolution, it is yet unclear that how such successful projects and communities have been formed and governed.
In this paper, we propose a method that can investigate the history of every project in the SCP.
Introducing the concept of &lt;em&gt;project as a city&lt;/em&gt;, we consider every project in the SCP as a city, where a government and citizens develop a city through collaborative activities.
We then identify essential attributes that characterize a state of a city.
For each attribute, we develop metrics that quantify the state $S(p,t)$ of a project $p$ at time $t$.
An experimental evaluation investigating GitHub projects of famous code editors shows that the proposed metrics well visualize the history of the projects from essential perspectives of a city.&lt;/p&gt;</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tamada.github.io/research/project_as_a_city/features.png"/></item></channel></rss>
