      <description>This tool deletes duplicated lines.
GNU core utilities have uniq command for deleting duplicate lines. However, uniq command deletes only continuous duplicate lines. When deleting not continuous duplicate lines, we use sort command together, in that case, the order of the list was not kept.
We want to delete not continuous duplicated lines with remaining the order.</description>

      <description>There are too many repositories. We love programming; however, to manage many repositories is quite hard and bothersome tasks. Therefore, we built a headquarter for managing the git repositories, named rrh. rrh manages repositories by categorizing in groups and execute git command to the groups.
I know the tool ghq, manages the git repositories. However, I cannot use it for the following reasons.
 there are quite many repositories in my home directory.</description>
