      <title>De-obfuscate DNR</title>

      <description>:speaking_head: Overview Using unevaluated obfuscation methods has a significant risk since the methods might have some vulnerabilities. One evaluation for obfuscation is de-obfuscation which discloses the hidden information by the obfuscation. This paper proposed the de-obfuscation method against for DNR (dynamic name resolution) obfuscation method. DNR hides system-defined names by encrypting them and resolves names dynamically during runtime. This paper clarifies the steps of de-obfuscation and proposes static and dynamic manners to de-obfuscate DNR.</description>

      <title>Identifying the applied obfuscator</title>

      <description>:speaking_head: Overview Recently, to prevent cracking, the various protection methods have been proposed. One of the protection methods is the obfuscation method. Obfuscation method changes the program into hard to understand for hiding secret information in the program.
On the other hand, de-obfuscation is an interesting research topic for protecting the software. Since, though vulnerable protection methods are dangerous, measuring the robustness of the method was not discussed.
In this paper, we tackle to identify the applied obfuscation methods towards de-obfuscation.</description>

      <title>De-obfuscate IRM</title>
      <link>https://tamada.github.io/research/deobfuscating_identifier_renaming/</link>

      <description>:speaking_head: Overview The obfuscation methods are often used to hide sensitive information in software. Especially, an identifier renaming method (IRM) is well used because it is easy to implement. IRM is one of the obfuscation methods, and to change the names of function, and variables into meaningless one. However, if we can restore the identifiers to the original names, IRM is invalidated. One of the serious problems about IRM is that the tolerance against de-obfuscation is not discussed.</description>
